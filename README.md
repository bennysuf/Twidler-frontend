# My Phase-3 Project - Twidler Frontend

## What my project is:
    Think unnamed social media platforms suck? too political? UI isn't very good?
    Let me introduce you to Twidler, a social media app, unrelated to a certain 
    big tech giant, that allows you to have fun with your friends by posting
    your thoughts and seeing your friends. 

## How to start it up:
    Clone the repository and open it in your terminal. 
    Run:
`$ npm install` or `$ npm i`

    Then to start the project, run:
`$ npm start`

    You will then be taken to the browser to start using the project.

**MAKE SURE THE BACKEND SERVER IS RUNNING!**

## How to use it:
    If you already have an account then login using your login information, 
    if not then click on create an account. 
    Once you are signed in you will be taken to the Home page,
    where you will see the posts from all of the users.
