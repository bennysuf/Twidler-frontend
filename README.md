## What my project is:

## How to start it up:
    Clone the repository and open it in your terminal. 
    Run:

    Once your dependencies are installed, run:
    `$ npm run server`

    Then in a new terminal, run:
    `$ npm start`

    You will then be taken to the browser to start using the project.
