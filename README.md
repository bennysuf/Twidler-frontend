# My Phase-3 Project - Twidler Frontend

## What my project is:
    Think unnamed social media platforms suck? too political? UI isn't very good?
    Let me introduce you to Twidler, a social media app that allows you to have fun
    with your friends by posting your thoughts and seeing your friends. 

## How to start it up:
    Clone the repository and open it in your terminal. 
    Run:
`$ npm install` or `$ npm i`

    Once your dependencies are installed, run:
`$ npm run server`

    Then in a new terminal, run:
`$ npm start`

    You will then be taken to the browser to start using the project.

**MAKE SURE THE BACKEND SERVER IS RUNNING!**

## How to use it:
    If you already have an account then login using your login information, 
    if not then click on create an account. 
    Once you are signed in you will be taken to the Home page,
    where you will see the posts from all of the users.

    To logout click on your Avatar on the top right side,

    When editing your account, you can only change your username. 
    You also have the option to delete your account.

- ONCE YOU CLICK 'DELETE ACCOUNT' YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REVERSE IT!
